Paris Transport

This project explores how Paris and its suburbs adapt their railway network to meet mobility needs and address related issues.
Overview
History of the Paris Metro
Past

    Necessity: Why was the metro needed? (growing population, London model)
    Construction: How was it built? (number of workers, construction time, quantity of materials used, types)
    Meeting Needs: How did it meet the needs of its time? (number of users, satisfaction)
    Evolution: How have the railway routes evolved and how has the Paris model extended to the suburbs (intra/extra km, interactive graph)

Present

    Current Structure: Interactive map, traffic, starting points
    Line Usage: Evolution graph
    Global Stats: Network statistics
    Modernization: Modernization of lines

Future

    Evolution: Future developments
